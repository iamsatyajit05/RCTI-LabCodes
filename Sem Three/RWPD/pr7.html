        <p class="fs-4">Blockchain technology has been making headlines for the past few years, and for good reason. This
            revolutionary technology has the potential to change the way we do business, and its applications are
            seemingly endless. In this blog, we will explore what blockchain is, why it is the future, and some of the
            ways it is already being used in the real world</p>

        <h2 class="my-4 text-center">What is Blockchain?</h2>

        <p class="fs-4">At its most basic, blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions between parties.
            Unlike traditional ledgers, which are typically maintained by a central authority, a blockchain ledger is
            distributed across a network of computers, known as nodes. This means that the ledger is not owned by any
            one person or organization, but is instead managed by the entire network.</p>

        <p class="fs-4">One of the key features of blockchain technology is that it is secure and immutable. Because transactions are
            recorded across multiple nodes, it is nearly impossible to tamper with the ledger. Additionally, each
            transaction is verified and authenticated by the network, making it virtually impossible to falsify records.
        </p>

        <h2 class="my-4 text-center">Why it is the future?</h2>

        <p class="fs-4">Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries, from finance to supply chain
            management. Its decentralized nature means that it is not subject to the same vulnerabilities as traditional
            systems, and its security and immutability make it ideal for storing and transmitting sensitive information.
        </p>

        <p class="fs-4">In addition to its security, blockchain also offers transparency and efficiency. Because the ledger is
            distributed across the network, all parties have access to the same information, and transactions can be
            completed quickly and with minimal fees.</p>

        <h2 class="my-4 text-center">Use case of Blockchain</h2>

        <p class="fs-4">One of the most well-known uses of blockchain technology is in the realm of cryptocurrency. The first and
            most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, uses blockchain technology to securely record transactions and
            prevent fraud.</p>

        <p class="fs-4">However, blockchain has applications beyond just cryptocurrency. For example, it is being used in the supply
            chain industry to track the movement of goods and ensure their authenticity. In the healthcare industry,
            blockchain is being used to securely store and share medical records. And in the financial industry,
            blockchain is being used to facilitate faster, more secure transactions.</p>

        <h2 class="my-4 text-center">Where to learn Blockchain?</h2>
        <p class="fs-4">If you are looking to learn about blockchain and its potential applications, there are many resources
            available
            online. Here are some of the best resources to get started:</p>
